### Command line arguments

Passing the arguments in command line into code is called command line arguments.

why command line arguments are required?
To run the code into different values. Don't allow user to modify the code and our code will be robust if we use the command line arguments.


sys module in python: sys modules used to take command line arguments

#sys.argv[0] sys.argv[1] is like special variables in bash($0 $1 etc)
#sys.argv[0] --> will take python file name as value

#input taken from user in python through argument is always consider ad string,we have to convert into required data type

### Environment variables

when you are deal with sensitive data,go with environmental variables.

like passing password,api etc.

creating env variable --> export password="Raghu"

os module for reading the environmental variables:

In python code, os.getenv("password").

## 1. Differences Between Functions, Modules, and Packages

### Functions

A function in Python is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword and can take inputs, called arguments. They are a way to encapsulate and reuse code.

resoans why we need to use:
1)code reusability --> calling same function with deffirent values to perform task.
2)readability
3)debugging easily

primary responsibity of function is --> take input,perform task and return output

**Example:**

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("Alice")
print(message)
```

In this example, `greet` is a function that takes a `name` argument and returns a greeting message.

### Modules

A module is a Python code and is colection of functions,classes,variables etc. 
That can be used in other Python scripts. Modules help organize and modularize your code, making it more maintainable.

why we need modules?
1)code reusability --> using the code of one python script into other python script

**Example:**

Suppose you have a Python file named `my_module.py`:

```python
# my_module.py
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

pi = 3.14159265
```

You can use this module in another script:

```python
import my_module

result = my_module.square(5)
print(result)
print(my_module.pi)
```

In this case, `my_module` is a Python module containing the `square` function and a variable `pi`.

### Packages

A package(some people call it as library) is a collection of modules organized in directories. Packages help you organize related modules into a hierarchy. They contain a special file named `__init__.py`, which indicates that the directory should be treated as a package.

**Example:**

Suppose you have a package structure as follows:

```
jenkins_package/
    __init__.py
    job_creation.py
    job_build.py
```

You can use modules from this package as follows:

```python
from jenkins_package import job_creation

result = job_creation.function_from_job_creation()
```

In this example, `jenkins_package` is a Python package containing modules `job_creation` and `job_build`.

## 2. How to Import a Package

Importing a package or module in Python is done using the `import` statement. You can import the entire package, specific modules, or individual functions/variables from a module.

**Example:**

```python
# Import the entire module
import math

# Use functions/variables from the module
result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)

# Import specific function/variable from a module
from math import pi
print(pi)
```

In this example, we import the `math` module and then use functions and variables from it. You can also import specific elements from modules using the `from module import element` syntax.

## 3. Python Workspaces

Python workspaces refer to the environment in which you develop and run your Python code. They include the Python interpreter, installed libraries, and the current working directory. Understanding workspaces is essential for managing dependencies and code organization.

Python workspaces can be local or virtual environments. A local environment is the system-wide Python installation, while a virtual environment is an isolated environment for a specific project. You can create virtual environments using tools like `virtualenv` or `venv`.

virtual environment is very usefull when you run mutiple projects in single system,some project require latest version of setuptool,some project require older vsersion of setuptool,problem will be sloved by creating virtual environment for each project to run in single machine.
while a virtual environment is an isolated environment for a specific project.


**Example:**

```bash

pip install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment (on Windows)
myenv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (on macOS/Linux)
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, you work in an isolated workspace with its Python interpreter and library dependencies.

come out from that virtualenvironment

deactivate
